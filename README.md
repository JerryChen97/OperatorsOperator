# OperatorsOperator
An accidental offer to help one of my collaborators brought both plenty of troubles and meanwhile a new idea for creating my own calculator for some common operators especially in physics.

Considering the fact that I will be extremely busy recently, I am just going to create some demos and then suspend as always =。=

The first one should be of course the simplest commutative relationship between spatial coordinates and momentum operator, i.e. x and p, with the relationship
[x, p] := xp - px = i\hbar
For a less physical purpose and with more mathematical interpretation, this should be viewed equivalently as
[∂, x] = 1
which is quite easy to check.
And then here comes our problem: if you wish to treat something like ∂∂∂xxx so as to shift ∂ to the front like xxx∂∂∂, for some certain purposes to calculate some physical quantities, how can we get the final expression?

Roughly a potential method is obviously to deal with this as a string manipulation problem, which is exactly I have done in my first demo.
